Overview
========

HookeAI is built around the `Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07801>`_ framework for material model updating, but it’s also a flexible, general-purpose library for **AI-driven material modeling research**. It includes a wide range of features and functionalities, such as:

* **Data generation methods**. Need to generate synthetic data to test your material model architectures? HookeAI includes tools to generate diverse strain-stress data sets as well as material patches undergoing all sorts of deformations!

* **Material model architectures**. Want to try out different material model architectures or implement your own? HookeAI includes a variety of pre-built conventional, neural network, and hybrid material models, and it’s easy to create your own custom architectures by following similar blueprints.

* **Local material model updating**. Have a rich strain-stress data set from numerical simulations and want to find a material model that explains the material behavior? HookeAI provides all the required tools to perform local, direct model updating as well as to test and validate the results.

* **Global material model updating**. Have experimental displacement-force data and want to find a material model that explains the material behavior? HookeAI includes all the required tools to perform global, indirect model updating.

* **Data analysis and visualization tools**. Need to better understand your data sets or the performance of your material models? HookeAI provides several material-related data analysis tools as well as a complete toolkit for data visualization.

* **Tensorial algebra and matrix operations**. Want to implement your own material model procedures and architectures without losing time with tensorial algebra and matrix operations? HookeAI has you covered, as it includes a comprehensive set of algebraic and matricial operations commonly used in material modeling.

* **Other utilities**. In addition to the core features mentioned above, HookeAI also provides a variety of complementary tools to streamline your material modeling workflow.
